## DO NOT USE OUT-SYL FUNCTIONS TO ACHIEVE IN-SYL

wooooo my SBA for absolutely no reason (I mean I have reason, which is DSE, well idk aaaaaaaa)

## Word Analysis and Plagiarism Detection System

### Task 1 (Design & Implementation)

Write a Python program to analyze articles from text files. The program should:

- Count the number of words in a text file.
- Sort the vocabulary alphabetically and by frequency.
- Check for potential plagiarism by comparing two articles and calculating their percentage of similarity based on word frequencies.

**Complete the following tasks:**\
(a) Select suitable data types and data structures.

- Justify your choices (e.g. dictionaries for word frequencies, lists for sorting).

(b) Count word frequencies in the text.

- Ignore case differences (e.g. "Hello" and "hello" are treated as the same word).
- Exclude punctuation marks and spaces during counting.

(c) Sort the vocabulary.

- Alphabetically (e.g. A-Z).
- By frequency (e.g. most to least frequent).

(d) Compare two articles and calculate similarity percentage.

- Design an algorithm to compare word frequencies between two text files.
- Calculate the percentage of similarity using a formula (e.g. (common_words / total_unique_words) \* 100).

(e) Use stepwise refinement to describe the algorithm.

- Break down the process into modular steps (e.g. file input, data cleaning, counting, sorting, comparison).

\
_You may want to consider some of the following key factors when designing the program:_\
\
_Use functions to ensure a modular approach (e.g. read_file(), count_words(), calculate_similarity())._\
_Validate input files (e.g. check if files exist and are non-empty)._\
_Handle errors gracefully (e.g. invalid file paths, empty files)._\
_Ensure clear output (e.g. display word counts, sorted lists, similarity percentage)._\
_Search for a target word, and/or replace it with another word._

\
**Deliverables:**

- Python program code.
- Documentation explaining your design choices and algorithms.

_Notes:_\
_Ensure your program handles edge cases (e.g. empty files, non-text formats)._\
_Focus on readability and reusability (e.g. add comments, avoid hard-coded paths)._

### Task 2 (Testing & Evaluation)

**Test your program and evaluate its performance.**\
(a) Conduct a test using the following test cases:

- Test Case 1: Two identical articles (similarity percentage should be 100%).
- Test Case 2: Two completely different articles (similarity percentage should be <15%).
- Test Case 3: Articles with partial overlaps (e.g. ~50% shared vocabulary).

(b) Record feedback and results.

- Document the accuracy of word counts, sorting, and similarity calculations.
- Identify limitations (e.g. case sensitivity, handling hyphenated words).

(c) Improve the program.

- Option 1: make one major change in the program and illustrate the corresponding improvement.
- Option 2: describe how the scope of the program could be extended.

**Create a document to illustrate the development of the program. You may want to consider some of the following:**

- Compare pros and cons of your initial design.
- Discuss algorithm optimization (e.g. improving efficiency for large files).
- Include screenshots of test results and code snippets in your report.

**Deliverables:**

- Report detailing test results, improvements, and reflections on the program’s design.

## WOO HERES WHAT I WILL DO

```none
1 year token for private repo access:
git clone https://TaokyleYT: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@github.com/TaokyleYT/23-26_ICT_SBA

command line & GUI (?)
CAN USE PYGAME WOOOO
(use tkinter instead bc hav matplotlib)
COLORED TEXT WITH ANSI ESCAPE WHY NOT
test case would be hard but okay maybe try try
count word: no special
sort: QUICK SORT ALL THE WAY
plagiarism: different test types, like word frequency, sentence matching, shows top matching results and stuff idk
plagiarism: might use the same concept of autocorrect system to detect

note: can use matplotlib or ascii graph to show result instead of numbers
(matplotlib implemented into GUI, ascii graph prob rejected)

should I train a big ahh neural network for plagiarism? idk it seemed a bit overkill lol
```
